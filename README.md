## Name 

Online Portfolio 

## Description

The goal of this project is to create an online portfolio to showcase my skills and web developement projects to potential employers. 

My webpage is split into 3 major sections: About Me, My Work, and Contact Me. This gives visitors a small summary of myself, some highlighted projects, and points of contact to reach me.  

I've created this webpage using semantic HTML, Advaced CSS, flexboxes, and media queries for web responsiveness. The nav bar links will scroll to the corresponding sections; and when clicking on the images in the "My Work" section, the user will be taken to the webpage of that deployed application.
